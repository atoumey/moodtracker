# Mood Tracker

This app runs on Pebble smartwatches and lets you scroll through a list of 
moods. When you select a mood, it posts your selection to a google
form/spreadsheet. Edit the source to include a link to your own google
spreadsheet and the appropriate POST parameter name.

Remember to track your mood on your watch and you now have historical data
on your moods!
